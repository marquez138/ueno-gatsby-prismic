It empowers website owners to do a lot without professional developers and some beautiful sites are out there. I help a number of friends and family host and maintain their WordPress sites. But for the kind of work we do here at Ueno, it just isn’t the right tool.\",\"spans\":[]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"WordPress makes it quite tricky for us to optimize things like SEO, loading time, generating social sharing previews and use the latest visual browser tools.

But when you’ve got that team, it holds them back.\",\"spans\":[]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"WordPress offers lots of plugins and customizations for the things mentioned above, but I’ve learned that the sweet spot for WordPress is when your site conforms somewhat to some standard patterns.

For many websites, this would be really impractical. You shouldn’t need a developer to add new press releases or to update job postings.\",\"spans\":[]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Where does that leave us? We like the owner empowerment that WordPress brings, just not the whole kit-and-caboodle. So, we’ve picked our technology stack in a way that splits the difference.

This is an ideal splitting point for us. The owners of the site can manage content in a central location and update it without developers.

The end-users, however, interact with a site that is better optimized for them.\",\"spans\":[]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Back to that awkward silence. Ultimately we’re all on the same page in what we want, we just have different pre-conceived notions of what that looks like. The reasons some clients want to do things in WordPress are good reasons.
